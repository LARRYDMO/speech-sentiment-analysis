Here’s a comprehensive `README.md` for your project, along with recommendations for uploading your project to GitHub:

### Speech Sentiment Analyzer

The **Speech Sentiment Analyzer** is a web application that converts spoken input to text, analyzes the sentiment of the transcribed text, and stores the results in a MongoDB database. This project demonstrates the integration of Flask, MongoDB, TextBlob, and SpeechRecognition for real-time sentiment analysis.

---

#### Features
- Converts speech to text using Google SpeechRecognition API.
- Analyzes sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) of the text using TextBlob.
- Stores results (text, sentiment, and timestamp) in a MongoDB database.
- User-friendly web interface built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

---

#### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Speech Recognition**: Python SpeechRecognition library
- **Sentiment Analysis**: TextBlob

---

#### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LARRYDMO/speech-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd speech-sentiment-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **MongoDB Setup**
   - Create a MongoDB cluster or use a local instance.
   - Update the `MONGO_URI` in `app.py` with your MongoDB connection string.

4. **Run the Application**
   Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Access the app at [http://127.0.0.1:5500/](http://127.0.0.1:5500/).

```

---

#### How It Works
1. Click **Start Recording** on the web interface to start speech recognition.
2. The application transcribes your speech to text and analyzes its sentiment.
3. Results are displayed in real-time and saved to MongoDB.

---

#### Environment Variables
- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string (default provided for demo).

---

#### To-Do
- Add authentication for MongoDB.
- Enhance sentiment analysis with custom ML models.
- Improve frontend with advanced UI features.
